          The jazzVIZ Project </strong> </p>
      <p>Thousands of jazz albums produced in the United States included
        thousands of musicians. Who played with who? Who was the most central
        musician in 1964? Where did studios produce the most albums? The network
        maps and visualizations below help to illustrate an answer to these
        kinds of questions. 
      <p></p>
      What you see here is the pilot phase of an ambitious
        project. While numerous websites store information about jazz albums and
        their artists who created them none permit for data analysis,
        manipulation, visualizations and/or extraction. When a full database of
        musicians, their albums, dates, studios and locations is developed, a
        great deal of questions can be thrown at it. 
      <p></p>Some great jazz documentation has been
        done already. Projects like jazzdisco.org and discogs.org have organized
        a great deal of information. Ideally, after demonstrating some of the
        ideas introduced above, raw data from these and similar sources can be
        made available. 
      <p></p>
      The purpose of the jazz database is to document American jazz through
        the 1970s. The goal is to create a set of "jazz data" in a universally
        available and systematic format that will ultimately be available as an
        education resource. When the database reaches a sufficient development
        level it will be released according to terms of a GNU Free Documentation
        License. There are several key steps along the way. First, a database
        design is needed, then the data must be collected, cleaned and
        organized. Examples of different visualuzations of jazz data are available here; click the tab that grabs your interest!
