          The jazzVIZ Project </strong> </p>

      <div class="w3-col m4 l3">
        <div> Thousands of jazz albums produced in the United States included
          thousands of musicians. Who played with who? Who was the most central
          musician in 1964? Where did studios produce the most albums? The
          network maps and visualizations below help to illustrate an answer to
          these kinds of questions.
          <p></p>
          <div style="margin-left: 80px; text-align: justify;"> </div>
          <div style="margin-left: 80px; text-align: justify;"> What you see
            here is the pilot phase of an ambitious project. While numerous
            websites store information about jazz albums and their artists who
            created them none permit for data analysis, manipulation,
            visualizations and/or extraction. When a full database of musicians,
            their albums, dates, studios and locations is developed, a great
            deal of questions can be thrown at it. </div>
          <div style="margin-left: 80px; text-align: justify;"> Some great jazz
            documentation has been done already. Projects like jazzdisco.org and
            discogs.org have organized a great deal of information. Ideally,
            after demonstrating some of the ideas introduced above, raw data
            from these and similar sources can be made available. </div>
          <div style="margin-left: 80px; text-align: justify;"> The purpose of
            the jazz database is to document American jazz through the 1970s.
            The goal is to create a set of "jazz data" in a universally
            available and systematic format that will ultimately be available as
            an education resource. When the database reaches a sufficient
            development level it will be released according to terms of a GNU
            Free Documentation License. There are several key steps along the
            way. First, a database design is needed, then the data must be
            collected, cleaned and organized. Examples of different
            visualizations of jazz data are available here; click the tab that
            grabs your interest! </div>
          <p></p>
          <div style="margin-left: 80px;"> For now, you can see the following
            developments below:<br>

            Concerning those data -- what will they look like? It might be best
            to think of them in terms of the "buckets" the database will use: <br>
          </div>
          <ul>
            <ul>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Artists</b>: A list of American jazz musicians, with
                  basic biographical data such as date of birth, date of death,
                  birthplace.</li>
                <li><b>Albums</b>: A list of albums, from <em>Kind of Blue </em>to
                  <em>This is Duke Ellington. </em>The album table will include
                  a data for each artist who performed on it.<em> </em>Links to
                  other tables table with Label Code (see below).<em><br>
                  </em></li>
                <li><b>Network Connections</b>: Simply a list of each artist and
                  what other artists he or she worked with on a published album.
                </li>
                <li><b>Labels</b>: A list of record studios and the various
                  labels each produced. This is a difficult set of data if not
                  only because there was not any standardization in jazz label
                  nomenclature until 1977 when the Label Code (LC) was
                  introduced by the International Association of Sound and
                  Audiovisual Archives (<a target="_top" title="IASA" href="https://www.iasa-web.org/cataloguing-rules/information-about-iasa">IASA</a>),
