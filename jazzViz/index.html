          <div style="margin-left: 80px;"> Thousands is an apt term for American
            jazz if you're thinking about representing it with data. <br>
            <br>
            What musicians played with other musicians? Where did studios
            produce the most albums? When did bands overlap with studio
            recordings? Social network analysis, maps and timelines correspond
            to these kinds of questions.</div>

          <div style="margin-left: 80px; text-align: justify;"> What you see
            here is the pilot phase of an ambitious project. While numerous
            websites store information about jazz albums and their artists who
            created them (like jazzdisco.org and discogs.org) none permit for
            data analysis, manipulation, visualizations and/or extraction. When
            a full database of musicians, their albums, dates, studios and
            locations is developed, a great deal of questions can be thrown at
            it.<br>
            <br>
            The purpose of the jazzViz project is to document American jazz from
            its inception through the 1960s. The goal is to create a set of
            "jazz data" in a universally available and systematic format that
            will ultimately be available as an education resource. When the
            database reaches a sufficient development level it will be released
            according to terms of a GNU Free Documentation License. There are
            several key steps along the way. First, a database design is needed,
            then the data must be collected, cleaned and organized. Examples of
            different visualizations of jazz data are available here; click the
            tab that grabs your interest!<br>

          <p>Alfred Lion and Max Margulis founded Blue Note records in 1939. It

          <h2>Lee Morgan's <i>The Sidewinder</i></h2>
          <p>There is no argument that Lee Morgan's The Sidewinder is an iconic jazz album.  The five musicians who made the album a reality were connected to many jazz greats. 
            In the network graph below you can see their sphere of influence. Billy Higgins, Joe Henderson, Barry Harris and Morgan himself are among the most connected musicians who were personnel on this album.</p>

          <h2>Many JazzViz Possibilities</h2>
          <p>Within the social networks of jazz musicians are cliques: groupings of musicians who work frequently with one another and end
          up as sub-groups within a larger network. Some of these cliques overlap and others do not. In the context of jazz history, the
          cliques may represent opportunities for sharing new jazz styles or other cases insulating a genre of artists from another.</p>
