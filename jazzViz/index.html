    <b> Jazz Visualizations!</b>
    <p> </p>
    <div> Thousands of jazz albums produced in the United States included
      thousands of musicians. Who played with who? Who was the most central
      musician in 1964? Where did studios produce the most albums? The network
      maps and visualizations below help to illustrate an answer to these kinds
      of questions.
      <p> </p>
      What you see here is the pilot phase of an ambitious project. While
      numerous websites store information about jazz albums and their artists
      who created them none permit for data analysis, manipulation,
      visualizations and/or extraction. When a full database of musicians, their
      albums, dates, studios and locations is developed, a great deal of
      questions can be thrown at it.
      <p> </p>
      Some great work has been done already. Projects like jazzdisco.org and
      discogs.org have organized a great deal of information. Ideally, after
      demonstrating some of the ideas introduced above, raw data from these and
      similar sources can be made available.<br>
      <br>
      For now, you can see the following developments here:<br>

      <a href="viz2">Network Map of the Blue Note 4000 Series</a><br>
      <br>
      <p> </p>
      The purpose of the jazz database is first, to document jazz data in a
      universally available and systematic format and second, if not equally
      important, is to create an education resource. When the database reaches a
      sufficient development level it will be released according to terms of a
      GNU Free Documentation License. There are several key steps along the way.
      First, the data must be collected. What are those data? It might be best
      to think of them in terms of the "buckets" the database will use: Artists:
      Albums: Network Connections: Simply a list of each artist and what other
      artists he or she worked with on a published album. Labels: A list of
      record studios and the various labels each produced. This is a difficult
      set of data if not only because there was not any standardization in jazz
      label nomenclature until 1977 when the Label Code (LC) was introduced by
      the International Association of Sound and Audiovisual Archives (IASA),
      which was founded in 1969.
