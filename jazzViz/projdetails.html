      <p style="margin-left: 120px; margin-right:80px">The purpose of the jazz database is to
        document American jazz through the 1970s. The goal is to create a set of
        "jazz data" in a universally available and systematic format that will
        ultimately be available as an education resource. When the database
        reaches a sufficient development level it will be released according to
        terms of a GNU Free Documentation License. There are several key steps
        along the way. First, a database design is needed, then the data must be
        collected, cleaned and organized. Analysis follows.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 120px; margin-right:80px">Concerning those data -- what will they
        look like? It might be best to think of them in terms of the "buckets"
        the database will use:<b><br>
        </b></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 120px; margin-right:80px"><b>Artists</b>: A list of American jazz
        musicians, with basic biographical data such as date of birth, date of
        death, birthplace.<b><br>
        </b></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 120px; margin-right:80px"><b>Albums</b>: A list of albums, from <em>Kind
          of Blue </em>to <em>This is Duke Ellington. </em>The album table
        will include a data for each artist who performed on it.<em> </em>Links
        to other tables table with Label Code (see below).<em></em><b><br>
        </b></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 120px;"><b>Network Connections</b>: Simply a list
        of each artist and what other artists he or she worked with on a
        published album.<b><br>
        </b></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 120px;"><b>Labels</b>: A list of record studios and
        the various labels each produced. This is a difficult set of data if not
        only because there was not any standardization in jazz label
        nomenclature until 1977 when the Label Code (LC) was introduced by the
        International Association of Sound and Audiovisual Archives (<a target="_top"
